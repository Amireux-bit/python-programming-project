The choice may be overwhelming, but should be made carefully. There are huge differences in standards and location is key to make your stay in Paris enjoyable and time used well. Be prepared to pay the price for Paris' popularity - even the cheap hotels are relatively expensive.\nDespite the popularity with tourists, global hotel chains have relatively low penetration of the Parisian market. A notable exception is the French-based Accor, which boasts over 300 hotels in the Paris area, although with large swathes of central Paris largely uncovered. There is a fair amount of Best Westerns as well, but most international chains limit their presence to very few exclusive (and expensive) hotels in key locations. Travellers loyal to a particular brand may find their loyalty challenged, be forced to pay for it (rather than be rewarded) or unable to find their hotel brand of choice in Paris.\nHotels in the central arrondissements tend to be expensive, although very cheap ones can also be found. With few exceptions, they tend to offer small rooms. In Paris, staying at a more expensive hotel will get you better standards of service and facilities, but will not necessarily get you a bigger room than a cheaper hotel. Rooms of 12-16 square metres (which is roughly half of standard hotels rooms e.g. in the USA) are the norm in central Paris, regardless of hotel standards.\nCheaper hotels in popular arrondissements tend to be older, less attractive properties, whose facilities and appointments may be very worn and outdated, far behind standards one would expect from the capital of all things pretty and fine. Even updated and restored hotels may exhibit wide variance in standards between room categories, and keep some of the rooms not refurbished or only minimally touched up to be able to offer attractive, eye-catching pricing for them and then upsell to more comfortable room categories. Always check out latest reviews, preferably with photos, to precisely determine what to expect from a given hotel and given room category.\nHotels outside of the city centre, or even outside of the Peripherique and Paris itself, can be far cheaper than ones in central Paris, while still having good transit links via metro or RER. That said, some of the suburbs outside of Paris have a sketchy reputation (see the crime section below for which ones) and you will keep in mind the added costs, time and difficulty in getting around the city.\nBecause of local preferences, a bathtub in the bathroom is a norm in most hotels, even if it means squeezing it into a very small bathroom, further limiting space. If you prefer a walk-in shower, you need to look for a hotel that specifically offers those (called \"douche italienne\" by the French), and you should generally look at newer, purpose-built properties.\nParis hotels, almost without regard to category or price, observe high and low season pricing. These differ slightly from one hotel to another, but usually the high season roughly corresponds to late spring and summer, and possibly a couple of weeks around Christmas.\nFor individual hotel listings see the various Arrondissement pages.\n\n--- (Source: paris.txt) ---\n=== Tourists and locals ===\nWhen you are looking for a restaurant in Paris, be wary of those where the staff speak English a bit too readily.

A notable exception is the French-based Accor, which boasts over 300 hotels in the Paris area, although with large swathes of central Paris largely uncovered.
