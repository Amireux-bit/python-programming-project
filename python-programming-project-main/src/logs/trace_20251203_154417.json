      "observation": "- [Verified Local Guide]:\n--- (Source: paris.txt) ---\nParis has an oceanic climate with moderately cold winters and warm summers. The moderating effect of the Atlantic Ocean helps to temper temperature extremes in much of western Europe, including France. Even in January, the coldest month, temperatures nearly always exceed the freezing point with an average high of 7 °C (45 °F). Snow is not common in Paris, although it can fall a few times per year. Most of Paris' precipitation comes in the form of light rain year-round. Daylight hours run from 08:45 until 16:45.\nSummers in Paris are moderately warm and humid, with an average high of 25 °C (77 °F) during the mid-summer months. Occasional heat waves can push temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) and rarely even reach 35 °C (95 °F). The sun is up from 06:00 until almost 22:00.\nSpring and fall are normally cool and wet.\n\n--- (Source: paris.txt) ---\n=== Events ===\nIt seems like there's almost always something happening in Paris, with the possible exceptions of the school holidays in August and February, when about half of Parisians are to be found not in Paris, but in the South of France or the Alps respectively. The busiest season is probably the fall, from a week or so after la rentrée scolaire or \"back to school\" to around Noël (Christmas) theatres, cinemas and concert halls book their fullest schedule of the year.\nGood listings of current cultural events in Paris can be found in Pariscope or Officiel des spectacles, weekly magazines listing all concerts, art exhibitions, films, stage plays and museums. Available from all kiosks. Timeout is a good option for tourists, who don't speak French.\nEven so, there are a couple of annual events in the winter, starting with a furniture and interior decorating trade fair called Maison & Object in January.\nIn February le nouvel an chinois (Chinese New Year) is celebrated in Paris as it is in every city with a significant Chinese and Vietnamese population. There are parades in the 3rd and 4th arrondissements and especially in the Quartier Asiatique (Asian Quarter) in the 13th south of Place d'Italie. Also in February is the Six Nations Rugby Tournament which brings together France, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy.\nThe International Agricultural Show (Salon Internationale de l'Agriculture) usually takes place over a week around the end of February/beginning of March at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre. It is unmissable (not just for tourists but also French politicians wanting to appear in touch with rural France), and showcases large numbers of domestic animals as well as selling speciality food products from all over France and its former colonies in Africa. Particularly recommended are the food stalls from the overseas territories where you can try regional specialities that are hard to come by even in Metropolitan France, and they will often also have performances from folk musicians/dancers. It's usually advised to buy tickets in advance as the queues for entry can be long.\nThe first of two Fashion weeks occurs in March: Spring Fashion Week, giving designers a platform to present women's prêt-à-porter (ready to wear) collections for the following winter.\nIn June, Rendez-vous au Jardin is an open house for many Parisian gardens, giving you a chance to meet real Parisian gardeners and see their creations. The Fête de la Musique celebrates the summer solstice (21 June) with this city-wide free musical knees-up. Finally on the 26th of June is the Gay Pride parade, featuring probably the most sincere participation by the mayor's office of any such parade on the globe.\nThe French national holiday Bastille Day on the 14th of July celebrates the storming of the infamous Bastille during the French Revolution. Paris hosts several spectacular events that day of which the best known is the Bastille Parade which is held on the Champs-Élysées at 10:00 and broadcast to pretty much the rest of Europe by television. The entire street will be crowded with spectators so arrive early. The Bastille Day Fireworks is an exceptional treat for travellers lucky enough to be in town on Bastille Day. The Office du Tourisme et des Congress de Paris recommends gathering in or around the champ de Mars, the gardens of the Eiffel Tower.\nAlso in July, Cinema en Plein Air is the annual outdoor cinema event that takes place at the Parc de la Villette, in the 19th on Europe's largest inflatable screen. For most of the months of July and August, parts of both banks of the Seine are converted from expressway into an artificial beach for Paris Plages. Also in July the cycling race le Tour de France has a route that varies annually, however it always finishes on the last Sunday of July under the Arc de Triomphe.\nOn the last full weekend in August, a world-class music festival Rock en Seine draws international rock and pop stars to the Domaine national de Saint-Cloud, just west of Paris.\nDuring mid-September DJs and (usually young) fans from across Europe converge on Paris for five or six days of dancing etc. culminating in the Techno parade - a parade whose route traces roughly from Place de la Bastille to the Sorbonne, and around the same time the festival Jazz à la Villette brings some of the biggest names in contemporary jazz from around the world.\nIn the beginning of autumn the vine harvest fest takes place. The most famous is the Fête des Vendanges de Montmartre, a food festival around the vine harvest of the Montmartre vineyard.\nThe Nuit Blanche transforms most of central Paris into a moonlit theme-park for an artsy all-nighter on the first Saturday of October, and Fashion Week returns shortly thereafter showing off Women's Prêt-à-Porter collections for the following summer; as we've noted winter collections are presented in March.\nThe third Thursday in November marks the release of Le Beaujolais Nouveau and the beginning of the Christmas season. This evening, the Christmas lights are lit in a ceremony on the Champs-Élysées, often in the presence of hundreds (if not thousands) of people and many dignitaries, including the president of France.\nUnfortunately, there are no comprehensive event guides covering concerts, clubs, movies or special events. For theatre, movies and exhibitions pick up the Pariscope and L'officiel du Spectacle, available at newsstands for €0.40. For (especially smaller, alternative) concerts pick up LYLO, a small, free booklet available in some bars and at FNAC. There is no user-friendly online version of these guides.\n\n--- (Source: paris.txt) ---\n== Understand ==\nParis sits on the River Seine, in north-central France. Around 2.2 million people live in the city of Paris, but this only represents the urban core within the Boulevard Périphérique. There are some 10 million in the wider Métropole du Grand Paris (814 km2) and almost 13 million people living in the metropolitan area, making this one of Europe's largest.\nDue to high expectations, a tight schedule, and language barriers, not to mention the large crowds and long lines at certain attractions during high season, the city also disappoints some visitors. Foreign visitors who have an idealized view of Paris might be shocked by the typical challenges of visiting any large city.  They expect romance, beauty, and luxury, but they find street crime, traffic noise, pollution, garbage, and relatively high costs. In the worst case, visitors might experience the Paris syndrome, which is a state of severe culture shock and anxiety – sometimes, severe enough that it even results in a psychiatric emergency that requires hospitalization.\nTo enjoy the wonders of Paris, make realistic plans. The number of attractions and landmarks is overwhelming; visiting only the most famous ones (which are overcrowded during major holidays) takes more than a week. The city also has more to offer for people who take time for a calm stroll along the backstreets. If your time in the city is short, be selective, and save some attractions for your next visit.",

The choice may be overwhelming, but should be made carefully. There are huge differences in standards and location is key to make your stay in Paris enjoyable and time used well. Be prepared to pay the price for Paris' popularity - even the cheap hotels are relatively expensive.\nDespite the popularity with tourists, global hotel chains have relatively low penetration of the Parisian market. A notable exception is the French-based Accor, which boasts over 300 hotels in the Paris area, although with large swathes of central Paris largely uncovered. There is a fair amount of Best Westerns as well, but most international chains limit their presence to very few exclusive (and expensive) hotels in key locations. Travellers loyal to a particular brand may find their loyalty challenged, be forced to pay for it (rather than be rewarded) or unable to find their hotel brand of choice in Paris.\nHotels in the central arrondissements tend to be expensive, although very cheap ones can also be found. With few exceptions, they tend to offer small rooms. In Paris, staying at a more expensive hotel will get you better standards of service and facilities, but will not necessarily get you a bigger room than a cheaper hotel. Rooms of 12-16 square metres (which is roughly half of standard hotels rooms e.g. in the USA) are the norm in central Paris, regardless of hotel standards.\nCheaper hotels in popular arrondissements tend to be older, less attractive properties, whose facilities and appointments may be very worn and outdated, far behind standards one would expect from the capital of all things pretty and fine. Even updated and restored hotels may exhibit wide variance in standards between room categories, and keep some of the rooms not refurbished or only minimally touched up to be able to offer attractive, eye-catching pricing for them and then upsell to more comfortable room categories. Always check out latest reviews, preferably with photos, to precisely determine what to expect from a given hotel and given room category.\nHotels outside of the city centre, or even outside of the Peripherique and Paris itself, can be far cheaper than ones in central Paris, while still having good transit links via metro or RER. That said, some of the suburbs outside of Paris have a sketchy reputation (see the crime section below for which ones) and you will keep in mind the added costs, time and difficulty in getting around the city.\nBecause of local preferences, a bathtub in the bathroom is a norm in most hotels, even if it means squeezing it into a very small bathroom, further limiting space. If you prefer a walk-in shower, you need to look for a hotel that specifically offers those (called \"douche italienne\" by the French), and you should generally look at newer, purpose-built properties.\nParis hotels, almost without regard to category or price, observe high and low season pricing. These differ slightly from one hotel to another, but usually the high season roughly corresponds to late spring and summer, and possibly a couple of weeks around Christmas.\nFor individual hotel listings see the various Arrondissement pages.\n\n--- (Source: paris.txt) ---\n=== Tourists and locals ===\nWhen you are looking for a restaurant in Paris, be wary of those where the staff speak English a bit too readily. These restaurants are usually geared towards tourists.
