Most of them are concentrated in the Barrio de las Letras and Sol area as well as the Paseo del Arte.\n\n--- (Source: paris.txt) ---\n=== Tourists and locals ===\nWhen you are looking for a restaurant in Paris, be wary of those where the staff speak English a bit too readily. These restaurants are usually geared towards tourists. It does make a difference in the staff's service and behaviour whether they expect you to return or not.\nSometimes the advertised fixed price tourist menus (€10-15) are a good deal. If you're interested in the really good and more authentic stuff (and if you have learned some words of French) try one of the small bistros where the French go during lunch time.",
