Since its founding in 1147, Moscow (Russian: Москва, Moskva) has been at the crossroads of history as the capital of empires and a frequent target for invaders. As the capital of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and, today, the Russian Federation, it has played a central role in the development of the largest country in the world. For many, the sight of the Kremlin complex in the centre of the city is still loaded with symbolism and history.
Today, Moscow is a thriving, exuberant capital city that overflows with life, culture and sometimes traffic. A sprawling metropolis, the northernmost and coldest megacity on the planet, and the most populous city entirely within Europe, Moscow is also known for its many museums, Soviet-era monoliths as well as post-Soviet kitsch.

== Understand ==

Moscow is the financial and political centre of Russia and the countries formerly comprising the Soviet Union. It has a population of around 13 million and an area of 2,511 square kilometres (970 sq mi) after an expansion in 2012.  Moscow is the second most populous city in Europe, after Istanbul, and has the most populous metropolitan area in Europe, with some 21 million residents, comprising roughly one-seventh of the population of Russia. Moscow is in the UTC+3 time zone; there is no daylight saving time.
Many years since the break up of the Soviet Union, the economy has improved, and the modern era has brought upon a wide variety of construction projects, modern architecture and newer transport systems. The Moscow Metro, in particular, is the longest and busiest subway system in Europe. The city also features Europe's largest concentration of skyscrapers.  


=== Geography ===

Moscow is a large metropolis on the Moskva River, which bends its way through the city. The historical center is on the northern bank of the river. The other major waterway is the Yauza River, which flows into the Moskva east of the Kremlin.
Much of Moscow's geography is defined by the 3 'Ring Roads' that circle the city at various distances from the centre, roughly following the outline of the walls that used to surround Moscow. With Red Square and the Kremlin forming the very centre, the innermost ring road is the Boulevard Ring (Bulvarnoye Koltso), built in the 1820s where the 16th century walls used to be. It runs from the Christ the Savior Cathedral in south-west central Moscow, to the mouth of the Yauza in south-east central Moscow.
The next ring road, the Garden Ring (Sadovoe Koltso), derives its name from the fact that landowners near the road in Tsarist times were obligated to maintain gardens to make the road attractive. In Soviet times, the road was widened, and there are now no gardens there.
The Third Ring Road, completed in 2004, is not much use for tourists but is a heavily used motorway which absorbs a bit of Moscow's traffic. It roughly follows the outline of Kamer-Kollezhsky val, the customs boundary of Moscow in the 18th – early 20th century. The outer edge of Moscow is largely defined by the Moscow Ring Road (widely known by its abbreviation: MKAD-Moskovskaya kolcevaya avto doroga), a motorway which is 108 km (67 mi) long and encircles the entire city (similar to London's M25 and Paris' Périphérique).


=== Climate ===
The climate of Moscow features warm summers and long, cold winters. Temperatures average below freezing for four months a year, between mid-November and mid to late March. Snow cover typically forms in late November or early December and melts in early April.

=== By train ===

Moscow is a railway hub, with connections to all parts of Russia as well as Asia. Due to its hub status, Moscow's train stations are always crowded, and pickpocketing is an issue, however police patrols and CCTV cameras are abundant, and violent crime is unlikely. Train travel is the predominant mode of intercity transportation for the majority of Russians.
All long-distance trains are operated by Russian Railways and its subsidiaries, except for a few international trains with other operators. Tickets can be bought at stations or online. There are usually ticket counters with English-speaking personnel - they may be marked as such, or the clerk may direct you to another counter if they can't cope with your English. See Russia#By train 2 for more details on travelling in Russia by train.


===== From Saint Petersburg =====
Saint Petersburg can be reached in 4 hours via the high-speed Sapsan trains. There are many daily departures each way, with some trains stopping at Tver, Vyshniy Volochek, Bologoye, and Okulovka. Fares vary and are cheaper if bought well in advance but usually start at 3,500 руб for economy class, if purchased 2 months in advance or 7,500 руб closer to the date of travel, if seats are even available. Trains almost always sells out.
There are also 13 overnight trains that travel between Moscow and Saint Petersburg and overnight trains are generally cheaper than the Sapsan. The most famous is the luxurious Red Arrow (Красная стрела), a train painted in bright red that departs Saint Petersburg daily at 23:55 while the song Hymn to the Great City plays on its loudspeakers.


===== From Eastern Russia and Asia =====

Tickets for the Trans-Siberian Railway sell out and it is cheapest to buy tickets at least 2 months in advance. Tickets can be bought online
The main line of the Trans-Siberian Railway runs between Moscow and Vladivostok, the biggest Russian city on the Pacific Coast. The Rossiya train leaves Moscow every other day at 13:20, while the slower but cheaper trains #44 or #100 leave every day around midnight. Major stops include Yekaterinburg (24-31 hours; 4000 руб for Platzkart class, 7,000 руб for 2nd class), Omsk (35-48 hours), Novosibirsk (46-54 hours), Krasnoyarsk (54-66 hours), Irkutsk (68-81 hours; 9,000 руб for Platzkart class, 11,000 руб for 2nd class), Ulan Ude (75-89 hours), and Vladivostok (7 days; 14,000 руб for Platzkart class, 25,000 руб for 2nd class}}).
The other routes of the Trans-Siberian Railway, between Moscow and China, are more popular among tourists. There are two weekly trains to/from Beijing, the Trans-Mongolian (Train #4) via Ulaanbaatar and the Trans-Manchurian (Vostok/Train #20) via Manchuria. Both journeys take six nights but the ride via Mongolia offers more scenery.


==== Train stations in Moscow ====
Moscow has 10 train stations, 9 of which are near metro stations close to the center of Moscow. Be sure to note the station from which your train is departing, which will be indicated on the ticket, or online. Three stations (Leningradsky, Yaroslavsky, and Kazansky) are on one huge square, informally known as the "Three Stations' Square". Be prepared for enormous queues trying to enter or exit the Metro at peak times, as people are getting off or on the commuter trains.


=== By car ===

Many entry points to Moscow over the Ring Road and into the city feature rotating roadblocks, where teams of traffic police may stop a vehicle, especially if it is not featuring Moscow plates. You may be stopped and questioned but you'll be allowed to proceed if you have all the proper documents.


===== From Europe =====
Foreign cars, especially expensive cars, might attract unwelcome attention, and there is cumbersome paperwork involved to enter Russia by car. The direct way to drive from Belarus is along the  road, although it requires having permission to enter Belarus. Russian Federal Highway  is another popular route. Traffic on the  is heavy.


=== By bus ===
It is generally easier to travel via plane or train so most visitors to Moscow will not use the intercity buses.
Ecolines operates coach service between Moscow and various cities in Europe, crossing at the border with Latvia. Buses arrive to and depart from the Severnye Vorota Bus Station next to the Khovrino Metro Station on Metro Line 2 (green) in the northern section of Moscow. Destinations include Riga (20 hours, RUB14,000), Tallinn (28 hours, RUB14,000), Vilnius (22 hours, RUB14,000), Warsaw (31 hours, RUB18,000), Minsk (9 hours, RUB2,100), Amsterdam (51 hours, RUB30,000), Prague (48 hours, RUB24,000), and Berlin (38 hours, RUB24,000).
Many domestic intercity buses stop at the Moscow Intercity Bus Terminal, next to the Shchelkovskaya Metro Station at the eastern terminus of Metro Line 3 (dark blue). Buses to the popular tourist destination of Suzdal operate from this station.
There are also several small bus stops and stations with buses to/from small towns that are not commonly visited by tourists.

5 Moscow Central (Schyolkovskiy) Bus Terminal aka Intercity bus station (Центральный Автовокзал, Московский междугородный автовокзал) (Shelkovskaya Metro station (the last station of the (3) line, in northeast Moscow). Under highway overpass), ☏ +7 499 748-8029. Daily 04:00-23:15. Intercity buses to Russian and some former Soviet Union cities depart from here. This is the only place in Moscow from which public transport is available directly to Suzdal.

=== By boat ===
There is no scheduled passenger service to Moscow by boat; however, cruise ships do provide service to the Northern River Terminal, on the Moscow Canal near the Khimki Reservoir. The pier is not convenient to the city and it can take over 2 hours to reach the city centre by car.
A system of navigable channels and locks connects the Moskva River with the Volga River, which is further connected to the Baltic Sea, White Sea, the Azov, the Black Sea, and the Caspian Sea. In the Soviet times this allowed the official propaganda to refer to Moscow as "a port on the five seas".


=== By bicycle ===
Moscow is the easternmost destination of the EuroVelo cycling routes. Eurovelo Route 2, the Capitals Route, is a 5,500 km (3,400 mi) route starting in Galway, Ireland, passing through Dublin, London, Berlin, Warsaw and Minsk before terminating in Moscow.


== Get around ==


=== By public transport ===
Yandex Maps is the best mobile app for planning journeys on public transport.
The metro is comprehensive, boasts some great architecture, and is relatively cheap. City buses, trolleybuses, trams and metro operated under "Moskovskii transport" franchise by different operators but common fare system.
The cheapest way to use the public transportation system is to purchase a plastic Troika re-loadable debit card. The card costs 50 руб and can be redeemed for cash at the end of your trip. You can "top up" your balance at any metro station. For each trip taken, 57 руб will be deducted from your card. If you make a change from the metro to a ground transport or other way around within the next 90 minutes of your trip, the next shoulder will cost you only 22 руб. The Troika card also can also be used via a mobile app. Troika cards can also be used to pay an Aeroexpress tickets, Velobike bike sharing, the entrance to the Moscow Zoo, the Tretyakov Gallery and the Lunarium Museum of the Moscow Planetarium. Alternatively, red paper cards can be purchased at metro stations at a cost of 70 руб per trip or 340 руб for 24-hours.
Also there is unlimited tickets for 1, 3, 30, 90 or 365 days which is very useful, if you plan to use public transport a lot.


==== By metro ====

The Metro is open from 05:30-01:00. Station entrances are closed at 01:00, and at this time the last trains depart from all of the termini stations. After 01:00, many locals will enter the train station using the exits, which are still open. Service on the ring line runs until 01:30, although entrances are closed at 01:00. The down escalators are also shut off at 01:00.
There is signage in the Metro stations in English and the Latin alphabet, but these signs are not everywhere. Each train carriage has a map in Latin script and there is one near the entrance to each station. Note the direction of the train before you alight. A map of the metro system in both Cyrillic and Latin letters is available online.
All trains in the system have free WiFi onboard, but you will need to have a Russian phone number to get the authorization code to access the WiFi. Some of the older train cars are not climate controlled.
2 or 3 stations may be connected as transfer points but will each have a different name. There are 2 stations called Smolenskaya and 2 stations called Arbatskaya, but the station pairs are not connected to each other despite having the same name. Some of the stations are very deep underground, and transfer times between certain metro lines can take a lot of time. In the city centre, it can save time to go directly to the above-ground entrance of the line you want to take rather than to enter at a connecting station and transfer underground. On the escalators, stand on the right and walk on the left except for peak hours, when standing on the left side is also allowed.
Some of the train stations include beautiful architecture and it is worth taking a guided tour of the metro system. The most interesting stations in terms of decor are Komsomolskaya (ring line), Novoslobodskaya (ring line), Kievskaya (ring line), Kropotkinskaya (Line #1 - red), Kievskaya (Line #3 - dark blue), Arbatskaya (Line #3 - dark blue), Ploschad' Revolyutsii (Line #3 - dark blue), Mayakovskaya (Line #2 - dark green). Also look at the architecture of the ground entrance building of Arbatskaya (Line #4 - light blue) and Krasnye Vorota (Line #1 - red). History buffs may appreciate that Metro Line #1 (red) has the oldest stations, opened in 1935.
The Vorobyovy Gory Metro Station on Line #1 (red) is unique in that it is on a bridge crossing the Moscow River. This bridge also carries auto traffic road on another level. There is a beautiful view through the transparent sides of the station. A great observing point around Moscow is located nearby on Vorobyovy hills, next to the main building of Lomonosov Moscow State University.
There are a couple of unique trains operating through the system and you will be lucky if you get to ride them. Aquarelle (Watercolor) is a train that includes an art gallery. The train operates daily on Line #3 (dark blue). The Sokolniki Retro Train is a train modeled after the original 1930s trains and it occasionally is placed into service, usually around a major anniversary of the metro system.
The metro is relatively safe, although pickpockets are a problem, as they are in any environment where a lot of people are pressed together. Opportunistic petty crime, such as snatching someone's mobile phone and jumping out just as the doors are closing, is also commonplace. Take the usual precautions at night when gangs of inebriated teenagers may look for an excuse to beat someone up. There is no train guard or conductor, so the first car near the driver may be the safest. Every car is equipped with an intercom to the driver's cabin; they are beige boxes with a grill and a black button near doors, and mostly work, unless visibly vandalized.


==== By Central Circle train ====
The Central Circle train operates on an old rail loop that lies between the Third Transport Ring and the Ring Road and was built in the beginning of the 20th century. It was then used for shuttling freight trains in and out of the city without having them clog the main stations. The comfortable Siemens Desiro trains (called "Lastochka" in Russia) provide service between 05:45 and 01:00, with 5-10 minute intervals. The entire circular journey takes an hour and a half. The Moscow Central Circle (МЦК -pronounced as Em-Tse-Ka) is integrated into the Moscow Metro, and is denoted by a pink hollow contour on the maps, but there are few interchanges, with some of the stations marked as adjacent being as much as 15 minutes apart on foot. It is, however, useful for trips that avoid transfers in the center, and the trains are rarely packed. The same tickets as for Metro are valid, and where you need to transfer from one mode to the other (and correspondingly leave the system and enter through the barrier again), the Troika cards would recognize it and not charge you the second time. Unlike the Metro, it is allowed to carry bicycles on the Central Circle.


==== By bus ====

Every large street in the city is served by at least one bus route. Most Moscow buses operate 05:30-01:00.
Numbers with an added 'к' or red sign ('к' for короткий — short) are shorter routes than their regular counterparts (for example bus 164 has a longer itinerary than 164к).
Numbers with an added 'м' (magistral routes; 'м' for магистральный) indicate more frequent routes, numbers with an added 'е' ('е' for экспресс, but uses cyrillic 'е' as there is the same letter 'e' in Latin alphabet) are express routes (which are subclass of magistral routes) and skip a lot of small stops.

Numbers with an added 'н' ('н' for ночной — night) indicate night services, few other routes also operate during the night.
Numbers with interval 901—908 are express buses, that skip many stops.
Main lines of buses are frequent until the late evening.


==== By tram ====
There are several tram routes, although trams are not common in the city centre. 


==== By commuter rail ====
Local commuter trains (electrichkas) operate between the Moscow train stations and the suburbs of Moscow Oblast, but are of little use for seeing the tourist attractions. Schedules can be accessed online at the official operator site and https://rasp.yandex.ru/.
Strelka and Troika cards are not valid for commuter trains, except if you have a multi-day commuter train ticket on your Troika card.
MCD (reads as Em-Tse-De) service of frequent trains - similar to Berlin's S-Bahn or Paris' RER - started on two lines, so some railway rides can be paid by Troika card. Single ticket costs 38 руб within the city limits and 45 руб within the closest outskirts.


=== By taxi ===

There are several taxi services operating in Moscow, the most noticeable on the streets being Yandex.Taxi; booked via the mobile app. Other popular hailing apps are Citimobil, Taxi Maxim, and Rutaxi - they all have English interfaces.
If you're not good in Russian, there are several English-speaking taxi services operating in Moscow, the most notable being LingoTaxi. Prices are generally higher but booking by phone is easier.


=== By car ===
Using a car in Moscow can be very time consuming and stressful. Moscow beyond the center is cut by railroads, industrial districts and rivers, so the road network is very irregular with tight bottlenecks between well-connected areas. The street system was never designed to accommodate even a fraction of today's vehicles and the traffic jams never seem to clear until the night. Evening jams lasting the entire night into the morning rush hours are rare but not unheard of. You will have to compete for the right-of-way with seasoned drivers who know the tangle of the streets inside out and will not think twice before cutting you off at the first opportunity. One bright spot is the dearth of the large 18-wheeler trucks on Moscow roads. Sometimes, all traffic on major thoroughfares may be blocked by police to allow government officials to blow through unimpeded, sirens blaring.
There is very little parking. Parking illegally can lead to a hefty fine of 2500 руб and your car being towed. If you are driving to Moscow, park as soon as you can at a safe place such as your hotel and use public transit. Parking is usually not free and the costs can be found online. Expect to pay 80 руб/hour for the parking within the Boulevard Ring and the district, 200 руб/hour - between Boulevard Ring and Garden Ring, 40 руб/hour between Garnen Ring and Third Transport Ring. Payment is available through SMS (Russian SIM-cards only), mobile app or at parking columns. You have to pay for the full hour upfront, unused money will be sent back to your account. Like many other Russian cities, parking spaces, even parking lots, are disorganized, making safe parking a challenge.
However, if you have driven in New York City, Rome or Athens before, then it's not that hard to get accustomed to Moscow traffic. Just don't try to drive across the city during rush hours or you can be stuck for as long as 3 hours in traffic jams. Check one of the many traffic jam information websites before you start your journey. Check Yandex Maps before you start your journey. Taking the metro may actually be faster than driving.
Many or most local drivers consider official speed limits more of a guideline than anything. Driving up to 19 kilometres per hour (12 mph) above speed limit usually isn't punished (at least for locals), and in many places driving 30–40 kilometres per hour (19–25 mph) above speed limit is common in case of light traffic. The punishment system for bad driving is very lax. Some mobile apps give warning about automated cameras and they see wide use. Besides, some cars operate with speedometer broken. This is especially the case of microbus drivers operating on private suburban lines. Reckless driving is common, especially late at night on mostly empty streets. Drunk driving isn't uncommon, especially late at night. Paradoxically, rush hours are a lot safer to drive at, since traffic flow speed is naturally restricted.
Roads are almost empty during holidays at the beginning of January and May as well as during weekends and the summer. Friday evening in broad summer (roughly April to October) show great jams towards outside the city, while Sunday evening and Monday morning show great jams towards the city. Great jams can surround May and winter holidays.
Gas stations: BP, Lukoil, Gazpromneft, Rosneft gas stations all have good quality gasoline.


=== By ship ===
Boats are not the best way to move around the city fast, but they do offer great scenery.

11 Stolichnaya Sudokhodnaya Kompania (Capital River Boat Tour Company). depart about once hourly, every day. Several scenic routes geared for tourists] with prices in the range of 400-800 руб. A pass is included in some hop-on-hop-off tours. 400-800 руб.    
12 Flotilla Radisson Royal, Naberezhnaya Tarasa Shevchenko, 9, (Ukraina Hotel embankment) (M: Krasnopresnenskaya). Several year-round cruises. Unlike other tourist boats, these boats can move on ice very smoothly so that the waiter can easily pour champagne in crystal glasses on a table. There are huge panoramic windows to protect against the wind. The food is overpriced. The trips depart from either Hotel Ukraina or Gorky Park. 650-2,000 руб.    


=== By bicycle ===
Velobike operates a bike sharing network that has over 4,000 bicycles available at over 430 bike stations throughout city. To use it, you first have to register on the web site, mobile app or via terminal on bike station. Membership rates are 150 руб per day, 500 руб for a month, or 1,200 руб for whole season. Usage fees, which are in addition to membership fees, vary, but the first 30 minutes are free. This is intentional to encourage people to use the system for short place-to-place trips; however, after riding for 30 minutes, you can dock your bike into a station, wait 2 minutes, and then take the bike out again to restart the timer. The service is only operational between April and November. After docking the bike you should get a text message confirmation. If you do not get a confirmation, you should call the company; otherwise, you may be fined.


=== By hop-on-hop-off bus ===
The hop-on-hop-off bus is a convenient way for tourists to see the major sights quickly and efficiently. The buses feature English-speaking guides to answer any questions. A 1 day pass costs RUB3,400 for adults and RUB3,000 for children.

Have a hot steam, followed by a good whipping with birch branches. While it's not the most pleasant experience, the benefits you'll receive afterward will enable you to understand why Russians are loyal to their banya.

This is a hold-over from the days of the USSR, when Sovietwide there were only a handful of wide-spectrum "universities" and a large number of narrow-specialization "institutes" (mostly in Moscow & St.Petersburg). Moscow offers some of the best business/management, science, & arts schools in the world. Moscow is also a popular destination for foreign students to learn Russian.

== Stay safe ==
Moscow enjoys a relatively low crime rate.

Drunk people are the most likely sources of problems. In the past years, lots of policemen were corrupt, and it was best to avoid them. Nowadays Moscow has a Tourist Police force, whose officers are able to speak foreign languages and help tourists. Police officers are equipped with body-cameras.
It is preferable to avoid some parts of the outer districts of Moscow, especially in the south. Some of those areas are notorious for gopniks (drunkards notorious for muggings and starting fights with strangers, and will do so seemingly unprovoked), who normally hang out in sparse residential areas and in industrial zones. The same problems can be witnessed in the surrounding regions and in other Russian cities as well.
While traveling in Moscow, as in the rest of Russia, you should always have your passport with you. If you look non-white, your papers may get checked more often than otherwise. The police may demand to see your papers to check if you have been registered within 7 business days of your arrival into Moscow. Always remember that if you stay in a hotel then you are automatically registered and will be handed a confirmation paper at a time of check-in, so don't worry in this case. The police are usually looking for migrants from Central Asia and unless you fit this profile, you are unlikely to be questioned.
Women should take caution walking alone late at night since they may receive unwanted attention from drunk men. Women should also stay clear of large companies of men in front of bars, restaurants, etc. It is best to walk with a friend if possible.
Streets can become very slippery in winter. Wear shoes or, even better, boots with decent grip to prevent twisted ankles. Ice patches can be hard to spot. A waterproof raincoat is also sensible.
Traffic is poorly handled, and vehicle accident rates are very high.
If you need help with translation, ask students or pupils: younger people are more likely to be able to help you than the older generations.
