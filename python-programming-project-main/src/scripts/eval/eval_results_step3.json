    "answer": "Based on the evidence provided, $800 USD should be sufficient for a 4-day trip to London, including hotel and food. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### **Flights**\n- **Round-trip flight**: The cheapest price found on [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.com/flights-to/lond/cheap-flights-to-london.html) is $316.\n- **One-way flight**: The cheapest price found on [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com/Cheap-Flights-To-London.d178279.Travel-Guide-Flights) is $143.\n\n### **Accommodation**\n- **Budget-friendly hotel**: [Ibis Budget London Whitechapel](https://www.kayak.com/London-Hotels.28501.hotel.ksp) offers rooms starting at $67 per night.\n- **4-night stay**: $67 x 4 = $268.\n\n### **Food**\n- **Daily food budget**: On average, food costs in London can be around $50-$60 per day for a basic meal plan (breakfast, lunch, and dinner).\n- **4-day food budget**: $50 x 4 = $200 (or up to $240 for more elaborate meals).\n\n### **Total Estimated Budget**\n- **Flights**: $316 (round-trip)\n- **Hotel**: $268 (4 nights)\n- **Food**: $200 (basic meal plan)\n- **Total**: $784.\n\nThis leaves you with approximately $16 USD for other expenses such as transportation or souvenirs. If you choose slightly more affordable options or stay outside central London, you might stay within your $800 USD budget.\n\n### **Suggested Itinerary**\n1. **Day 1**: Arrive in London. Check into your hotel and explore nearby areas. Dinner at a local pub.\n2. **Day 2**: Visit iconic landmarks like the British Museum and Camden Market. Lunch at a street food vendor.\n3. **Day 3**: Explore the West End and Leicester Square.
