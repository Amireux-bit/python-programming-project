    "difficulty": "hard",
    "scenario": "budget_feasibility",
    "status": "success",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence provided, it is challenging to visit Singapore for 3 days with a total budget of 300 USD due to the high costs of flights and accommodations. However, if you are flexible with your travel dates and destinations, you might find cheaper options. Here's a possible breakdown:\n\n### Flights:\n- **Expedia**: Round-trip flights start from $107 (https://www.expedia.com/Cheap-Flights-To-Singapore.d3168.Travel-Guide-Flights).\n- **KAYAK**: The cheapest price found was $277 for the route Seattle (SEA) to Singapore (SIN) (https://www.kayak.com/flight-routes/United-States-US0/Singapore-SG0).\n\n### Accommodation:\n- **Hotel Mono**: A budget-friendly option with basic rooms, priced around $100 per night (https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/13sgmyd/any_cheap_and_affordable_stays_in_singapore_for/).\n\n### Food:\n- **Groceries**: Approximately $400- $600 SGD per month, which translates to about $30- $50 USD per day (https://www.travejar.com/blog/daily-food-cost-in-singapore).\n- **Dining Out**: A single meal can cost around $25- $30 USD, including taxes (https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1480rwm/what_is_the_average_cost_of_a_restaurant_or/).\n\n### Sightseeing:\n- **Gardens by the Bay**: Entry ticket is SGD 34 (approximately $25 USD) (https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/things-to-do-singapore/).\n- **Night Safari**: SGD 54 (approximately $40 USD) (https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g294265-Activities-Singapore.html).\n\n### Transportation:\n- Public transportation is relatively affordable, with an average daily pass costing around SGD 10 (approximately $7.50 USD) (https://www.22places.com/what-to-do-in-singapore/).\n\n### Budget Breakdown:\n- **Flights**: $277 (round-trip from Seattle).\n- **Accommodation**: $300 (3 nights at Hotel Mono).\n- **Food**: $75 (3 days at $25 per day).\n- **Sightseeing**: $65 (Gardens by the Bay and Night Safari).\n- **Transportation**: $22.50 (3 days at $7.50 per day).\n\n### Total Estimated Budget: $739.50 USD\n\nThis exceeds your budget of 300 USD. Therefore, it is not feasible to visit Singapore for 3 days within a 300 USD budget based on the evidence provided.",

      "final": "Based on the evidence provided, it is challenging to visit Singapore for 3 days with a total budget of 300 USD due to the high costs of flights and accommodations. However, if you are flexible with your travel dates and destinations, you might find cheaper options. Here's a possible breakdown:\n\n### Flights:\n- **Expedia**: Round-trip flights start from $107 (https://www.expedia.com/Cheap-Flights-To-Singapore.d3168.Travel-Guide-Flights).\n- **KAYAK**: The cheapest price found was $277 for the route Seattle (SEA) to Singapore (SIN) (https://www.kayak.com/flight-routes/United-States-US0/Singapore-SG0).\n\n### Accommodation:\n- **Hotel Mono**: A budget-friendly option with basic rooms, priced around $100 per night (https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/13sgmyd/any_cheap_and_affordable_stays_in_singapore_for/).\n\n### Food:\n- **Groceries**: Approximately $400- $600 SGD per month, which translates to about $30- $50 USD per day (https://www.travejar.com/blog/daily-food-cost-in-singapore).\n- **Dining Out**: A single meal can cost around $25- $30 USD, including taxes (https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1480rwm/what_is_the_average_cost_of_a_restaurant_or/).\n\n### Sightseeing:\n- **Gardens by the Bay**: Entry ticket is SGD 34 (approximately $25 USD) (https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/things-to-do-singapore/).\n- **Night Safari**: SGD 54 (approximately $40 USD) (https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g294265-Activities-Singapore.html).\n\n### Transportation:\n- Public transportation is relatively affordable, with an average daily pass costing around SGD 10 (approximately $7.50 USD) (https://www.22places.com/what-to-do-in-singapore/).\n\n### Budget Breakdown:\n- **Flights**: $277 (round-trip from Seattle).\n- **Accommodation**: $300 (3 nights at Hotel Mono).\n- **Food**: $75 (3 days at $25 per day).\n- **Sightseeing**: $65 (Gardens by the Bay and Night Safari).\n- **Transportation**: $22.50 (3 days at $7.50 per day).\n\n### Total Estimated Budget: $739.50 USD\n\nThis exceeds your budget of 300 USD. Therefore, it is not feasible to visit Singapore for 3 days within a 300 USD budget based on the evidence provided."
